#PET CREATOR
##MINI PROJECT
###Step 1
Create an input in the App component that updates the
state with a Pokémon name. (You know it's my destiny.)
###Step 2
Add an object with the pokémon name to a list of
pokemon in your state. Do this via a button click.
(You teach me and I'll teach you.)
###Step 3
Create a child app that renders your pokémon list state from
its parent. (Our courage will see us through.)
###Step 4
Click a pokemon in the child component, to update the display
pokemon of the parent.
